## Discription

This project uses JavaScript to add dynamic behavior to the given HTML and CSS.

## Functionality

* The navigation bar is created dynamically by adding list items to the unordered list given in the HTML file.

* You can access any section by clicking its name in the navigation bar and it will scroll to the wanted section.

* The section that is currently in the viewport will be marked as active and will get highlighted.

* If the user scrolled to the fold of the page, an arrow pops up that can be clicked on to go back to the top of the page.

* The navigation bar is responsive, so if the user is on mobile, a hamburger menu will be shown that the user can click on to view or hide the section names.
